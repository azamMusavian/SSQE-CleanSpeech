# SSQE-CleanSpeech
Self-Supervised Quality Estimation of Speech Using Only Clean Data This project proposes a self-supervised framework for speech quality estimation without the need for paired noisy-clean data. Inspired by VQScore, our method leverages only clean speech during training to estimate perceived quality, enabling efficient and scalable quality modeling.
